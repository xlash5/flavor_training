# flavor_training

With flutter flavors, you can easily create different versions of your app for different environments. This is a simple example of how to use flavors in your flutter app. 
You can have different main.dart files for each flavor, and you can define different values for each flavor depending on your environment.

As you can see in the example, you can have different values for the same variable depending on the flavor. We have a message displating different values depending on the flavor. You can also see that counter and counter_add are different for each flavor.
